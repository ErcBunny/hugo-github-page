### About This Page
* Based on Github Pages and Hugo framework
* I initially want it to be an online self-introduction to help with graduation application: it feels better updating websites than frequently editing and exporting [**CV**](https://github.com/ErcBunny/sharedDocs/raw/main/CV-yueqian-en.pdf) and [**project description**](https://github.com/ErcBunny/sharedDocs/raw/main/Project%20Experience.pptx). But I think it can be more than just that...
* Thanks to Jimmy for creating this beautiful theme and allowing people without WEB experience to build such a nice website
